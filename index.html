<h2>CS11 Project Plan Outline</h2>

<p>
  Justin Leong's project plan outline for 2017 CS11 Spring Term.
</p>

<hr>

<dt>Webpage</dt>
<dd>
  The project is to create a personal website and blog with an Elixir backend
  and Elm frontend.
</dd>

<dt>Description</dt>
<dd>
<p>
  The goal for this project is to become more familiar with Elixir and to
  learn Elm while using these languages to build a personal website. Since
  Elm and Elixir are both functional languages, I will be able to develop
  my functional programming skills and be exposed to what is hopefully a
  better frontend language than Javascript.
</p>
<p>
  I will also be learning how to set up a DNS and building the site up from
  scratch and exploring the Phoenix web framework.
</p>
</dd>

<dt>Programming Language(s)</dt>
<ul>
  <li>
    Elixir - I have used Elixir before for a internal reviews application for
    my internship last summer.  I worked on it during a weekend hackathon and
    two week sprint so I have limited experience. I wanted to become more
    familiar with a functional language and was debating between Ocaml,
    Clojure, Scala, Elixir, Scheme, or another Lisp.  I also wanted to learn
    how to use Lisp macros and it looks like Elixir supports macros.

  </li>
  <li>
    Elm - I haven't used Elm before but hope to learn it. I've heard good
    things about the frontend language from the Second Spectrum CTO. It was
    implemented in Haskell and took a lot of the design philosophy (statically
    typed functional) of Haskell. I interned at Second Spectrum and will work
    there after I graduate.
  </li>
  <li>
    Javascript - I know the basics from CS11 and last summer's internship.
  </li>
  <li>
    HTML - I know the basics from last summer's internship.
  </li>
</ul>

<dt>External Libraries</dt>
<dd>
  Phoenix - an Elixir web framework; I have used it in the internal reviews
  application for my internship last summer.
</dd>

<dt>Risk Analysis</dt>
<dd>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        I am unfamiliar with setting up my own server and domain name. To
        mitigate this risk, I bought a domain on dnsimple and a server on
        Digital Ocean (called a "Droplet") over spring break. I only had to
        pay for registering the domain since the GitHub Student Developer Pack
        offers one year credit for using Digital Ocean and for a DNS plan.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        I am unfamiliar with the Elm programming language. I will do some Elm
        tutorials before working on the website to gain some familiarity with
        the language. Also, the milestones in the implementation are mostly
        focused on creating functionality rather than a good UI except for
        Week 8 which is dedicated to experimenting with Elm to improve the web
        pages.
        <a href="https://www.elm-tutorial.org/en/">
          https://www.elm-tutorial.org/en/</a>
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        I have limited familiarity with Elixir and Phoenix. I dedicated an
        entire week to setting up the framework on the server. I also allocate
        part of Week 5 to catch up in case I fall behind on this step. In
        addition, I chose to go with Phoenix and Elixir over Yesod and Haskell
        partially due to the additional documentation.

<dt>Implementation Plan</dt>
<dd>
  <p>
    Since I am a senior, I will have 10 weeks instead of 11 to complete this
    project.
  </p>
  <p>
    Week 1 - Go through the Elm tutorial and make any necessary revisions to
    project plan outline.
  </p>
  <p>
    Week 2 - Finish setting up basic page using the Phoenix web framework.
    Either integrate this into GitHub Pages or on my Digital Ocean
    Droplet/server.
  </p>
  <p>
    Week 3 - Implement backend to hold blog posts, titles, dates, etc. using
    Elixir.
  </p>
  <p>
    Week 4 - Create simplistic home page which displays the titles and dates
    for blog posts using Elm.  Design should be similar to
    <a href="http://openmymind.net/">Karl Seguin's blog</a>
  </p>
  <p>
    Week 5 - Write unit tests for backend (and frontend if possible) and catch
    up on previous weeks if necessary.
  </p>
  <p>
    Week 6 - Implement pages for displaying blog posts. Add links to GitHub
    and LinkedIn.
  </p>
  <p>
    Week 7 - Implement logging for correctness. Log 404s, etc.
  </p>
  <p>
    Week 8 - Experiment with Elm features to make the web pages look good.
  </p>
  <p>
    Week 9 - Optimize for speed and displaying on mobile.
  </p>
  <p>
    Week 10 - Continue optimizing, catch up on any parts that I missed and
    write a blog post with my final report and what I learned from the
    project.
