<h2>CS11 Project Plan Outline</h2>

<p>
  Justin Leong's project plan outline for 2017 CS11 Spring Term.
</p>

<hr>

<dl>

<dt>Webpage</dt>
<dd>
  The project is to create a personal website and blog with a Haskell backend
  and Elm frontend.
</dd>

<dt>Description</dt>
<dd>
<p>
  The goal for this project is to become more familiar with Haskell and to
  learn Elm while using these languages to build a personal website. Since
  Elm and Haskell are both functional languages, I will be able to develop
  my functional programming skills and be exposed to what is hopefully a
  better frontend language than Javascript.
</p>
<p>
  I will also be learning how to set up a DNS and building the site up from
  scratch and exploring the Happstack web framework.
</p>
</dd>

<dt>Programming Language(s)</dt>
<ul>
  <li>
    Haskell - The extent of my experience is taking CS115 last year. I
    wanted to become more familiar with a functional language and was debating
    between Ocaml, Clojure, Scala, Elixir, Scheme, or another Lisp.  Although I
    did want to learn Lisp macros, since Second Spectrum uses Scala, Clojure,
    and Elixir on some of their projects, I figured I would get more exposure
    to those after I graduate whereas I might not work with monads as often.
    I interned at Second Spectrum and will work there after I graduate.
  </li>
  <li>
    Elm - I haven't used Elm before but hope to learn it. I've heard good things
    about the frontend language from the Second Spectrum CTO.
  </li>
  <li>
    Javascript - I know the basics from CS11 and last summer's internship.
  </li>
  <li>
    HTML - I know the basics from last summer's internship.
  </li>
</ul>

<dt>External Libraries</dt>
<dd>
  Happstack - a Haskell web framework
</dd>

<dt>Risk Analysis</dt>
<dd>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        I am unfamiliar with setting up my own server and domain name. To
        mitigate this risk, I bought a domain on dnsimple and a server on
        Digital Ocean (called a "Droplet") over spring break. I only had to
        pay for registering the domain since the GitHub Student Developer Pack
        offers one year credit for using Digital Ocean and for a DNS plan.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        I am unfamiliar with the Elm programming language. I will do some Elm
        tutorials before working on the website to gain some familiarity with
        the language.

      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
</dd>

<dt>Implementation Plan</dt>
<dd>
  <p>
    Week 1 - Go through the Elm tutorial and make any necessary revisions to
    project plan outline.
  </p>
  <p>
    Week 2 - Finish setting up basic page using the Happstack web framework.
  </p>
  <p>
    Week 3 - Implement backend to hold blog posts, titles, dates, etc. using
    Haskell.
  </p>
  <p>
    Week 4 - Create home page which displays the titles and dates for blog
    posts using Elm.  Design should be similar to http://openmymind.net/
  </p>
  <p>
    Week 5 - Write unit tests for backend (and frontend if possible) and catch
    up on previous weeks if necessary.
  </p>
  <p>
    Week 6 - Implement pages for displaying blog posts.
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
    Week 9 - Optimize for speed and displaying on mobile.
  </p>
