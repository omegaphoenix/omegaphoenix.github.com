<h2>CS11 Project Plan Outline</h2>

<p>
  Create a document that contains each of these sections, and send it to your
  CS11 instructor.  Your document must be in one of the following formats:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Plain text</li>
  <li>HTML</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Do not submit MSWord documents or PDF files.  TeX documents are also a pain.
</p>

<hr>

<dl>

<dt>Webpage</dt>
<dd>
  The project is to create a personal website with a Haskell backend and Elm
  frontend.
</dd>

<dt>Description</dt>
<dd>
  Briefly describe your project in 1-2 paragraphs, covering what interesting
  features or implementation details you intend to cover.
</dd>

<dt>Programming Language(s)</dt>
<ul>
  <li>
    Haskell - The extent of my experience is taking CS115 last year. I
    wanted to become more familiar with a functional language and was debating
    between Ocaml, Clojure, Scala, Elixir, Scheme, or another Lisp.  Although I
    did want to learn Lisp macros, since Second Spectrum uses Scala, Clojure,
    and Elixir on some of their projects, I figured I would get more exposure
    to those after I graduate whereas I might not work with monads as often.
    I interned at Second Spectrum and will work there after I graduate.
  </li>
  <li>
    Elm - I haven't used Elm before but hope to learn it. I've heard good things
    about the frontend language from our CTO.
  </li>
  <li>
    Javascript - I know the basics from CS11 and last summer's internship.
  </li>
  <li>
    HTML - I know the basics from last summer's internship.
  </li>
</ul>

<dt>External Libraries</dt>
<dd>
  List any external libraries (i.e. libraries that are not a standard component
  of the language you have chosen) that you will be using.  Note any of these
  libraries that are unfamiliar to you.
</dd>

<dt>Risk Analysis</dt>
<dd>
  <p>
    Identify any aspects of your project that could potentially hinder your
    progress in completing it.  This could include the following:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        Lack of familiarity with particular aspects of the problem domain
        that you want to focus on.  Example:
      </p>
      <p>
        "I don't know how hard it will be to get the fluid dynamics
        computations correct, since I haven't done that before."
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Lack of familiarity with particularly important or challenging aspects
        of a language or library that you intend to use.  Example:
      </p>
      <p>
        "I don't know how to debug Cg GPU shader programs, so it is
        possible that I will run into bugs that are difficult to identify
        quickly."
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Uncertainty about the feasibility of being able to perform a particular
        task with a chosen library or language.  Example:
      </p>
      <p>
        "I don't know if the Java Native Interface (JNI) will allow me to move
        my data from Java code to C code at the throughput necessary for a
        reasonable frame rate."
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Uncertainty as to whether a particular language or library has support
        on the desired target platform.  Example:
      </p>
      <p>
        "I'm not sure if the MP3 encoding library I want to use will compile on
        MacOSX, where I ultimately want to deploy my project."
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    For any risk items you list, briefly state what you intend to do to mitigate
    that risk.
  </p>
</dd>

<dt>Implementation Plan</dt>
<dd>
  <p>
    Write up an outline of how you intend to go about implementing this project.
    Be as specific as possible.  If there are stages of your project where you
    don't know how you are going to implement them, make sure to note this.
  </p>
  <p>
    This plan should take into account the above risk analysis.  If there are
    specific risk items, focus on them first!  Software project management is
    largely about identifying and controlling risk.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is acceptable to set aside some time for testing/debugging your project.
    The result of such a step should be either an automated test suite, or a set
    of well-documented test scenarios that one can walk through.
  </p>
</dd>

<dt>Source Code Availability</dt>
<dd>
  <p>
    You need to make your source code available to your CS11 instructor.  There
    are three options.  Feel free to provide more than one option.  A website is
    particularly recommended for purposes of coordination.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      If you are familiar with source code management systems (e.g. CVS or
      Subversion), state the details of how to connect to the repository and
      download a copy of the source code.
    </li>
    
    <li>
      If you don't know what all that is about, state your CS cluster username
      here, and the directory on your CS account where you will make your
      source code available.  Make sure that this directory exists, and that it
      is read-accessible to people other than you!
    </li>
    
    <li>
      It is also strongly recommended that you provide a website for your
      project, where you post updates, documentation, and any other important
      details.  You can use your CS cluster account for doing this, by putting
      your HTML files into your <tt>~/public_html</tt> directory of your CS
      cluster account.  Then it can be accessed like this:

      <pre>  http://www.cs.caltech.edu/~someuser</pre>

      (Where, of course, <tt>someuser</tt> is your CS cluster account name.)
    </li>
  </ul>
